# NAME

Demo::Module - To be used in TPC in Glasgow, 2018

# AUTHOR

# DESCRIPTION

This module will be used during my presentation in The Perl Conference
in Glasgow, 2018. I want to show how to use "kyzn/perlbrew-prc" docker
container to quickly start working on Perl modules. For that, I needed
a dummy module that uses dzil and has minimal external dependencies.

This package is not intended to be uploaded to CPAN.
